Keyboard Checker website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on October 2023, updates are to come

- Mostly created using HTML and CSS, some JavaScript was used

Issues:
1. When pressing the function keys, it activates the web browser's shortcut (e.g. F1 in Chrome activates help, and so on..)
2. Haven't fixed the design when zooming
3. Keyboard is based on my personal keyboard, so some other keyboards like Mac can't really test fully here -> Complex problem, will have to use some libraries (Node.JS?)
